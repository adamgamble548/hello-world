Hello world of Developers,

My name is Adam, I have recently began diving into the world of Developing as an effort to change the path of my life. I have many hours to spare, and plan to use them wisely! I have began the Free course from www.freecodecamp.com, and am about to coincide it with the course by Colt Steele (web developer bootcamp) on Udemy. I plan on partkaing in both courses side by side to try and cement my knowledge. I plan on learning as much as i can starting with the basics, which i understand are html, and css. And then spending heaps of time trying to master Javascript. Ever want to give me some help. Please Do!! :D
